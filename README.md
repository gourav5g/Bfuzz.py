# bfu\zz - Directory Brute Forcing Tool

**bfu\zz** is a powerful and efficient directory brute-forcing tool written in Python. It is designed to help security professionals and enthusiasts discover hidden directories and files on web servers.

## Features

- **Multi-threading**: Perform multiple requests simultaneously to speed up the brute-forcing process.
- **Customizable Wordlists**: Specify your own wordlists or use built-in options for flexibility.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the target server.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages and manages common HTTP errors.
- **Logging**: Save results to a file for later analysis.
- **Template Support**: Define templates for different brute-forcing scenarios.
- **User -Friendly CLI**: Clear command-line interface with helpful options.
- **Progress Indicator**: Show progress during the brute-forcing process.
- **Support for HTTPS**: Handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests seamlessly.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your Linux system. You can check your Python version with:
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the `requests` library if it is not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Download the Tool**: Clone the repository or download the `bfuzz.py` script directly.

3. **Save the Script**: If you downloaded the script, save it as `bfuzz.py`.

4. **Make the Script Executable**: Change the file permissions to make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bfuzz.py
   ```

## Usage

Run the tool using the following command, replacing the placeholders with your actual target URL and wordlist path:

```bash
python3 bfuzz.py -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 10 -d 0.5
```

### Command-Line Options

- `-u`, `--url`: Target URL with `FUZZ` placeholder (e.g., `http://target.com/FUZZ`).
- `-w`, `--wordlist`: Path to your wordlist file.
- `-t`, `--threads`: Number of threads to use (default: 10).
- `-d`, `--delay`: Delay between requests in seconds (default: 0.5).

## Example

```bash
python3 bfuzz.py -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 20 -d 1
```
